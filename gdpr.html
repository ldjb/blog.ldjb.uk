<h1>Unavailable For Legal Reasons</h1>
<img src="eu_flag.svg" alt="Flag of the European Union" style="height: 5em;">
<p>The numerous directives and regulations issued by the European Union have resulted in a situation where it is now immensely difficult to operate a website whilst complying fully with EU law.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32002L0058">ePrivacy Directive</a> has caused website operators problems for many years, and the new <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32016R0679">General Data Protection Regulation</a> poses an even greater threat &ndash; violations can result in fines of millions of euros.</p>
<p>Under the pretence of protecting the rights of citizens, the European Union has instead taken away the rights of website operators, especially those who cannot afford to hire teams of lawyers to ensure compliance.</p>
<p>It is with regret that, for these reasons, I must take the unfortunate step of closing this website until my home country &ndash; the United Kingdom &ndash; withdraws from the European Union on 29<sup>th</sup> March 2019.</p>
<p>Until we meet again.</p>
